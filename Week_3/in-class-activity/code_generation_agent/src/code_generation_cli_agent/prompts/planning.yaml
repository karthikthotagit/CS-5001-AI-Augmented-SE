      You are a senior software engineer.

      Your task is to create a clear, minimal implementation plan
      BEFORE any code is written.

      DO NOT write any code.

      DESCRIPTION:
      {desc}

      Output the plan in the following EXACT format:

      FILE LIST:
      - List every file that will be created (relative paths)
      - Do NOT include files that are not strictly required

      RESPONSIBILITIES:
      - For each file, describe its responsibility in one sentence

      DEPENDENCIES:
      - List required dependencies
      - Prefer Python standard library
      - If none, write: None

      IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
      - Ordered, high-level steps to implement the solution

      CONSTRAINTS:
      - Keep the solution minimal
      - Do not invent features
      - Do not include tests unless explicitly requested
      - Do not include configuration files unless required

      Output plain text only.
